# ambulance-path-recognition-system



Optimal and efficient path recognition for ambulance through a busy real time environment and collection of victim data at the site of incident.

Problem statement
Optimal and efficient path recognition  for safe movement of ambulance through a real time busy environment for faster movement of the victim from  source to destination in order to save time to reach the destination and collection of the victims data at the site of incident.

Detail version
Identification of optimal and efficient path for the movement of ambulance through a busy real time environment such as traffic and congestion through road transportation and collection of the victims status through a database and providing it to a certified doctor to take the right first aid measures for treatment of victim. Currently the movement of ambulance is done manually by a driver who knows the path , which may not be an optimal or an efficient path. Hence identification and recognition of optimal path is necessary for faster service and ease of transportation to handle critical situation where time plays an important role. Our proposed model uses shortest path recognition using various algorithm to find the optimal path.





Proposed solution
Emergency vehicle Routing System: Dijkstra's Algorithm, one the most efficient algorithms for solving the shortest-path problem can be implemented. In a network, it is frequently desired to find the shortest path between two nodes. The weights attached to the edges can be used to represent quantities such as distances, costs or times. For the purpose of this work time is used as the impedance because the shortest time for the vehicle to carry out the emergency services is desired.

Requirement and specification 
The main idea of this project is to find fastest path for emergency vehicle with minimal disruption of regular traffic flow   on real life road network and traffic conditions and thus minifying loss of lives and properties in emergency situations.

Functional requirements 
1.	A database to store the patient state information.
2.	Connectivity of patient record to the doctor.
3.	Online verification for legitimate entry of the victim state information through 
the portal.
4.	The data base should we logged in after the right login is made.
5.	The data base should take the appropriate values when the entry is made.
